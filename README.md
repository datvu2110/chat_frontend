# LetsChat
LetsChat is a simple and intelligent application that keeps you and your friends stay connected

This repo is the front-end client, built in React.  You can see the app live at [https://letschat2110.herokuapp.com/](https://letschat2110.herokuapp.com/)

The app is meant for mobile use, but will still scale for desktop viewing.

To check out the app, I suggest you create a dummy account so you can see the onboarding experience.  But, if you just want to view what a program looks like, you can use the demo account.
